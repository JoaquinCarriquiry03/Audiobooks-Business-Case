# Audiobooks-Business-Case
The data used in this notebook comes from an Audiobook App and it relates to the audio versions of books. Each customer in the database has made a purchase at least once, that's why they are in the database. We want to create a machine learning algorithm based on our available data that can predict if a customer will buy again from the Audiobook company.
